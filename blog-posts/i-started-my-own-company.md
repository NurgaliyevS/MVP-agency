### I have been working in the software industry for more than 5 years now. 

Have worked with big corporations and small companies. I launched multiple products when I was doing my engineering degree in university.

### After starting my job, I was building products as side projects. 

Nights and weekends became my playground for innovation, launched more than 30 products (websites, web apps, mobile apps). Some of them worked, and some of them just failed straight away.

### After countless sleepless nights and multiple iterations building my own products and failing a lot of times. 

I started to launch SaaS products because that's what I am good at. However, I quickly learned that technical skills alone weren't enough to generate sustainable revenue. But I knew that it was not that easy to start generating revenue from that.

### I decided to pivot to MVPAgency, an MVP-focused software development company, to start bringing in revenue while I bootstrapped my other products. 

I registered LLC in the USA. The idea of MVPAgency was in my mind for quite a while now. During my career, a lot of people used to come to me for seeking guidance on starting their journey, building their MVPs, and navigating the early stages of product development.

### I started validating with X, posting content about MVPs, how to build MVP yourself, what to use, where to find customers, the main idea of MVP, and how to solve problems as quick as possible.

I am here not to teach someone. I wanted to share my own story, and in every situation, try to find something positive.

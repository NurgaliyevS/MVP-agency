## Introduction: Why Psychology Matters in MVP Development

Holy smokes, you're ready to build a minimum viable product! But wait - before you dive into the technical specs and feature lists, there's something even more fundamental you need to understand: the psychology of your users. After all, the most technically perfect MVP in the world won't matter if it doesn't click with real human beings.

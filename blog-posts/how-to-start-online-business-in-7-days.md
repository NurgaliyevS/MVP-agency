### Easy to do now. 

There are several tips that I can give you to start your own digital business.

### 1. Solve your own problem. 

If you use the Internet, you know that there are a lot of problems that need to be solved. But focus on your problem first. Once you can figure it out and solve your problem. You can move on to solving people's problems. Ideally, to use tools and technology you know. 

If you don't know, use NO-CODE tools to build it. For example, if you need to create a website, use landing page builder. If you want to automate your own work, like booking meetings, use Zapier to automate tasks. If you want to create a game, sure, use AI Tools to solve it.

I don't care what you will use. Use whatever you want. All I want from you is to solve that problem.

### 2. After solving your own problem. 

You can focus on people's problems. Because if you can't solve your own shit, why do you want to solve others problems? Remember that always.

If you need to build e-commerce, use Shopify. If you need to build a directory, use directory builder. If you need to build landing pages, use landing page builders.

Rule of thumb: Niche, Niche, Niche. Try to focus on a specific niche, solve their problem, and make money on it. Then only thinking about exploring new opportunities.

You can use No-Code builders or AI tools or hire developers or hire agencies to do it. It depends on your choice. If you are good at coding, build on your own or delegate to a developer or agency. If you have enough time, use AI Tools to build your own thing. If you want to solve a common problem but with a different perspective, yeah, sure, use No-Code builders for that.

### 3. Digital business works exactly the same as offline business with one difference. 

You can move a lot faster, build a lot faster, risk a lot faster, fail a lot faster, earn a lot faster, sell a lot faster, and scale a lot faster.
In one week, you can build e-commerce. In the second week, you can build SaaS. In the third week, you can build an AI agent. In the fourth week, you can build your own channel on social media.

### 4. It gives more power. 
With great power comes great responsibility. From day one, invest in SEO, social media presence, traffic, and acquiring customers.
Don't focus on tech stuff. Don't focus on tools.
Focus on the real problem:
• Traffic
• Marketing
• Sales
• Conversion rate

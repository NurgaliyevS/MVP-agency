### All you really need is a checkout link to start.

I failed a lot of times. Literally I could build the whole landing page, admin panel, ai automation to handle moderation and content. After spending months in vacuum building more, more, more features. Launching and getting 0 customers in the end.

### You are literally just getting depressed.

You know that feeling, right ? Me too.

### We missed one important step before building anything - ASKING. 
We need to ask more clients, users, and do our research based on Google Keywords, forums and subreddits.

You probably won't do it. It is your choice. You have all rights to do it. Let me give one piece of advice, instead of building more features and spendings months on your MVP.

### Set a deadline in 2-4 weeks. 
Build it, launch it, and go live as soon as possible. You need to get a real feedback and face a reality.

### Most of the companies that you see, started with simple Excel file, Google Doc, or even paper with pen. 
Do you know why ? Because they didn't have anything in the beginning. No money, no customers, NOTHING.

### Remember that.

[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development.
[Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis.
[MVPAgency](https://mvpagency.org/) is a digital agency that helps startups to build MVPs.

## The Lean MVP Development Framework

### Resource Optimization Principles

When you're looking to build a minimum viable product, every dollar and hour counts. Here's how to make them work harder:

1. **Time Management**
   - Sprint planning
   - Resource allocation
   - Milestone tracking

2. **Budget Control**
   - Cost monitoring
   - Resource prioritization
   - ROI tracking

## Strategic Planning for MVP Builds

### Defining Your Minimum Viable Core

Before diving into development, answer these crucial questions:

1. What problem does your product solve?
2. Who are your early adopters?
3. What features are absolutely essential?

Create a feature priority matrix:

| Feature Type | Priority | Resource Impact |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Must-Have | High | 40% of resources |
| Should-Have | Medium | 30% of resources |
| Nice-to-Have | Low | 20% of resources |
| Future | None | 10% planning |
